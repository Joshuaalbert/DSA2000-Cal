    """
    Approximate tree for nearest neighbor search on 2D box.

    A tree structure is used to find the k nearest neighbors to a given point in 2D space, by constructing a grid of
    shape (n_grid, n_grid) where,

    n_grid = int(sqrt(n / average_points_per_cell)), where n is the number of points.

    The memory usage goes as O(n * ( 2 + kappa / sqrt(average_points_per_cell))).

    The tree build time goes as O(n).

    The tree query time goes as O((average_points_per_cell + kappa * sqrt(average_points_per_cell)) + k log k)

    Accuracy generally increases with more points in the tree. Accuracy decreasses with larger `k` queries due to cell
    edge effects.

        average_points_per_cell: Average number of points per cell in the grid.
